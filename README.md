# AI-Model-for-Epidemiology-of-Tuberculosis
Epidemiology of a disease provides a thorough and exhaustive analysis of the transmission and control of viral infections. The intended outcome aims to exercise the Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning models in order to understand the substantial effects of Tuberculosis in India. Our proposal aligns with the vision of National Strategic Plan 2017-2025 and aims towards understanding the challenges for TB prevention. Our aim is to predict the future outline of TB and understand itâ€™s impact through correlation of the factors such as climatic conditions, pollution parameters and population density on most at risk TB diaspora from state to district level. A host of Tuberculosis data segregated in comorbidities (Pediatric, Geriatric, HIV) from the multiple states and districts of India will be correlated with climate data, accustomed to bring optimal precision to the prediction model in order to increase the efficacy of the system. A graphic user interface will be provided to improve the comprehension of the expected solution to assist in geographically visualizing the control of Tuberculosis in India and its effects in the near future.
