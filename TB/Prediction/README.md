# All Models

This subsection includes all the code written to develop the prospective models during the initial period. The main models are :

- Bayesian Neural Networks

- Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)

- Gradient Boost

- Long Short Term Memory Model (LSTM)
 
- Multilayer Perceptron

- Recurrent Neural Network (RNN)

- Random Forest 

- Residual Networks (RESNET)

- XG Boost

# Final Models

This section includes the code for the most efficient of the prospective models used for prediction. Following are the fianl models :

- **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)** - MOST EFFICIENT

- Gradient Boost

- Multilayer Perceptron

- Long Short Term Memory Model (LSTM)
