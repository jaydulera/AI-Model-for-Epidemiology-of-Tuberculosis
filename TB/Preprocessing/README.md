# Preprocessing
Data preprocessing is a process of preparing the raw data and making it suitable for a machine learning model. It is the first and crucial step while creating 
a machine learning model. This process includes cleaning the data i.e. removing any abnormalities or outliers if present in the input data, finding out if the raw
data has any missing values and splitting the data into training and test data set.
