# Prediction
The folder contains all Python Notebooks used in developing the prediction models. It is subdivided into two folders : 

**All Models**

This subsection includes all the code written to develop the prospective models during the initial period. 

The main models are :

- Bayesian Neural Networks

- Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)

- Gradient Boost

- Long Short Term Memory Model (LSTM)
 
- Multilayer Perceptron

- Recurrent Neural Network (RNN)

- Random Forest 

- Residual Networks (RESNET)

- XG Boost

**Final Models**

This section includes the code for the most efficient of the prospective models used for prediction. 

Following are the final models :

- **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)** - MOST EFFICIENT

- Gradient Boost

- Multilayer Perceptron

- Long Short Term Memory Model (LSTM)



# Preprocessing
Data preprocessing is a process of preparing the raw data and making it suitable for a machine learning model. It is the first and crucial step while creating 
a machine learning model. This process includes cleaning the data i.e. removing any abnormalities or outliers if present in the input data, finding out if the raw
data has any missing values and splitting the data into training and test data set.



# Time Series Forecasting
Time series forecasting is the process to generate the input parameters for the prediction model. In this case the input parameters are that of Pollution, Climate
and Population factors during the period of 2019 to 2024. The folder contains all the Python Notebooks that were used to generate this data.
